groovy-word-similarity
======================

Practicing with Groovy / Gradle / Spock

A word is similar to another word only if: 

	- at most 1 letter is different (ie: tomato and tomata = similar) or

	- there is at most 1 extra letter (ie: tomato and tomatox = similar) or 

	- there is at most 1 letter missing (ie: tomato and tomat = similar)


Tips:

To start a groovy project with Gradle: gradle init --type groovy-library (it creates a src folder, gradle config files such as build.gradle with spock dependency)

To build: gradle build
To run tests: gradle test
To run main class: gradle run (put this line at build.gradle --> mainClassName = "wordSimilarityChecker.Main")

SLF4J: This project uses SLF4J implemented with Logback. It uses jlc-over-slf4j in order to be able to adapt
Jakarta-Commons-Logging to SLF4. If any project uses other interface to log, check http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j to find the appropriate adapter.
