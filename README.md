groovy-word-similarity
======================

Practicing with Groovy / Gradle / Spock

A word is similar to another word only if: 

	- at most 1 letter is different (ie: tomato and tomata = similar) or

	- there is at most 1 extra letter (ie: tomato and tomatox = similar) or 

	- there is at most 1 letter missing (ie: tomato and tomat = similar)




Groovy tips:

To start a groovy project with Gradle: gradle init --type groovy-library (it creates a src folder, gradle config files such as build.gradle with spock dependency)

To run test: gradle test To run main file: groovy path/filename.groovy
